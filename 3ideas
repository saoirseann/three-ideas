# My Three Final Project Ideas

## Reading Review app – Readsly (Read Endlessly)

#### Overview

How might we encourage more people to enjoy the social aspect
of their love for reading?

Book readers need a space where they can share the books, they love
online. They need a private space targeted to these needs, whilst also the option of a
 public platform where they share their reviews, favourite books and currently reading
 lists.


I would also incorporate public and private reading challenges for users, so they
 would be able to keep track of their reading habits per month/ year. Whilst also giving them the option to have competitive reading challenges with their friends/ family.

An idea with the public reading challenges is that I could incorporate some form of
 leadership board, where you’d be able to have competitive challenges with you friends
over how many books you’ve read, with each user receiving points for how many
books they've read. This would give it a fun, challenging aspect that other
 reading apps are missing.

Create an app and/ or website that will allow users to have their own
private profile section where they can keep track of their reading habits,
challenges, new releases from the authors they follow.


#### Pros

* There's a market and current need for this app with the
only other option available being Goodreads. (awful
user interface, design and isn't very mobile friendly. Restricting users
to primarily use it on their desktop devices only.)

* Everyone loves books!

* I'm an avid reader, so very keen on this idea becoming a reality.

* Could encourage people to waste less time on social media
* Somewhat confident in my front-end skills to be able to code this or
  keep it entirely in the design aspect through creating interactive prototypes
* I love design so could use my strengths in Illustrator/ Procreate in order to
make this app stand out through the use of flat icons, gifs and character design
representing users.

#### Cons

* Isn't a unique idea as it's been previously created

* If it isn’t done well, it will just be another unused reading app out there

* I have no experience in building an app before, could be too much of a risk and
challenge

* Unsure whether to fully build the app or will it just be as successful as
an interactive prototype - would use Adobe XD (could also learn Figma)


#### How might it be built?
* I think this project might be best as an app, due to the space in the market for a
  good reading app. (Goodreads is primarily used as the desktop version)

* I want to challenge myself through learning a new skill so could teach myself
   2-D animation/ GIF making in order to make the app interactive and interesting for users

* HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a fully responsive website
* Swift - If I consider making it an IOS app and available for users to download

#### Who's it for?
The target market for this app would be for everyone of all ages, particularly
those who are book lovers. – I’d have no set age range as it's an idea which could be implemented and used by anyone, from young children to adults.
When taking into consideration the design for this app, I’ll need an easy to navigate UI,
bright colourful icons and illustrations/ animations. However, I need to ensure that the design will be suitable for everyone, so I’ll need to research the psychology of colour design and the importance it’ll play in my app.
Could primarily be used from young students as it could potentially be another social
media platform which takes off and becomes one of the “go-to” social medias that you
 frequently check.


#### What's the business model?
I could add an amazon affiliate program to the app/ website in order to earn a commission when a user buys a book through the special tracking link.

I could also add different types of accounts for the app, so the possibility of having the app free for users with limited availability as to what users can do with it.

Then the option of moving up to a premium or patron account which would give the app more exclusively and unique selling points for these paying customers.

The key differentiator for my reading app is that it could have the possibility in the future,
of using a Machine Learning Algorithm which would recognise users reading preferences and
as a result of this begin to recommend similar authors and book categories personalised and targeted for only themselves.


## Mindfulness App / E-book - Calm your inner self

#### Overview
Depression & anxiety are on the increase,
especially as young adults we need a healthy way to deal with this.
To incorporate healthy habits, yoga, meditation, breathing techniques etc all into the one safe space.

This app will help those in need, to look after their mental health, to take regular breaks, check in with themselves emotionally and to access how their feeling.

It would bring something different as it would be a combination of a range of
yoga, meditation, body-scans, breathing guides

I could also add yoga video tutorials for beginner and intermediate levels.

#### Pros

* Helpful and needed app for many – a place where it could be everything, they need in one instead of having to rely on several different mental health apps

* I could learn Swift in order to create an IOS app and research on how to make it available on the app store

* I could learn new CSS layouts in order to create a modern and clean website with interactive video elements as follow step-by-step yoga tutorials

* Could also be the option for this to be an eBook promoting just how beneficial yoga is for your mental and physical health

#### Cons

* Very overused idea that has been created with a large variety of different apps

* I’ve never created an eBook before so could be a challenge trying to find content

* Can’t add video tutorial aspects to a digital book unless it was a separate link within the book leading off to its own website.

* Never used Swift so could either go very well or very badly (SkillShare/ Udemy will be helpful for tutorials)

#### How might it be built?

* An interactive IOS app with video tutorials

* Need to learn Swift to be able to do this or else Android studio

#### Who's it for?

A wide audience from young people to older users- but primarily more focused on users
 who are going through rough transitions in their lives.
I want an illustrative approach for the app to make it interesting and fun for users to learn from.

#### What's the business model?

Subscription service, free level of tutorials then with the option of paying for premium where users would have more access to resources

Mental health charities could sponsor or buy the site in order to build up their own resources


## Volunteer App - Volunteer your time to help combat loneliness in the elderly

#### Overview


I want to create an app which promotes not only volunteering in the local community but also helps combat loneliness in the elderly. As over half of all people over the age of 75 live alone, whilst most people say their TV is their only company.

It would be great to solve this issue so that not only do we have such high statistics
 for loneliness, but we’d also be encouraging young people to use their free time more effectively.

This app would be beneficial for everyone, especially the elderly users who suffer
 from loneliness/ isolation.  Organisations could also get involved, such as AgeUK
 and Elder Helpers. Giving them much needed connections and companionship.
It would be like a job opportunity app however it would differ in the fact that
it would be solely focused on volunteering opportunities.
The young person would be able to input how much free time they have available
during the week, what their interests are and how far they’re willing to travel.
Whilst the organisation could input the various elderly users that need help with
simple tasks or just need someone's company.

#### Pros

* Helping solve a major and current issue now with loneliness
* Unique idea - combining volunteering and a need to help
* Not sure how it would make money - whether charities could fund it and sponsor it
across social media platforms
* I'm more design focused so could play to my strengths by trying to make the
app as illustrative as possible

#### Cons
* Limited to an app - could also be effective as a website but not challenging myself
enough if I only create a website on its own
* Don't know swift or anything about app development- could be challenging to learn new skills and potentially adapt them in the future though
*

#### How might it be built?
* HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Swift
* digital working prototype using Figma and Adobe XD

#### Who's it for?
Young people, the elderly and local charities and charities and organisations who help fight
against loneliness in the elderly.

### What's the business model?

The business model would be targeted at organisations and charities who may want to
adapt the app to use for their own organisations. They would pay a fee to buy the
app from the apps store. Or I could offer the app to the organisations on a subscription service, where they would have to pay monthly in order to get full advantage of the app.

I could offer different types of accounts, which would offer different services
so, for premium for example they would need to pay a fee if they need more than 5 volunteers
that week.
